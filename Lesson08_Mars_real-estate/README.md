 - Moshi library
 - Glide library
 - Error Handling
 - Parcel and Parcelables


## Key takeaways - What was new for me?



### RetroFit
Is a library that creates a network api based on the content of the web service. If fetches data from the web service and uses a converter library that creates useful object instead of plain data.




### Permissions
Permissions protect the privacy of the user. You have to add the permissions for the usage of internet for example. Camera, GPS and a lot more.



### RecyclerView ViewHolder
A ViewHolder describes an item view and metadata about its place within the RecyclerView.
RecyclerView.Adapter implementations should subclass ViewHolder and add fields for caching potentially expensive findViewById(int) results.




### Moshi Library
It makes it easy to parse JSON into Java objects and it can just as easily serialize Java objects as JSON. Moshi has built-in support for reading and writing Java’s core data types:

-   Primitives (int, float, char...) and their boxed counterparts (Integer, Float, Character...).
-   Arrays, Collections, Lists, Sets, and Maps
-   Strings
-   Enums

### Glide
Glide is a fast and efficient open source media management and image loading framework for Android that wraps media decoding, memory and disk caching, and resource pooling into a simple and easy to use interface. [Git-Repo](https://github.com/bumptech/glide)

### Parcel and parcelables
Parcelable is an Android only interface which is used to serialize a class so its properties can be transferred from one activity to another.
